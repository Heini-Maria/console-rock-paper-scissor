## Personal experience with the project

This was a really good practice using Javascript and gave me a lot more confidence in functions. Also, this was the first time I used prompts to collect user inputs. If I would build the project from start I would probably make it more simple. I think especially the part where the all-time winner is determined is more complicated than it should be. All and all was happy to finish the project and see it working without crashing.
